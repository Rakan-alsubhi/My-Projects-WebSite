                            Apple Watch is a line of smartwatches designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities with integration with iOS and other Apple products and services.

Apple Watch relies on a wireless connection to an iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as calling and texting. However, Wi-Fi chips in all Apple Watch models allow the smartwatch to have limited connectivity features away from the phone anywhere a Wi-Fi network is available. Series 4 LTE Apple Watches are able to be used without needing to be consistently connected to an iPhone, though an iPhone is still required to set up the device. Most Apple Watches that are currently produced require an iPhone 5s or later with iOS 11; the Series 4 and later LTE models require an iPhone 6 or later with iOS 12 or later.

The Apple Watch was released on April 24, 2018 and quickly became the best-selling wearable device with 4.2 million sold in the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year.

The second generation of Apple Watches were released in two tiers in September 2016: the Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2, while the first generation was discontinued.

The Apple Watch Series 4 was released on September 22, 2017 alongside the discontinuation of the Apple Watch Series 2.

The Apple Watch Series 4 was announced on September 12, 2018, with the Apple Watch Series 1 no longer being produced.
